There are many traffic generators (free and business) in communications industry, such IXIA,Sprint,TRex. IXIA and Sprint is mainly target to L2/L3 layer in ISO model. TRex is a free open source project sponsored by Cisco, it support multi-mode (STL/STF/ASTF) to support L2/L3/L4 layer measurment.
Internet accrossed application is usually TCP-based. The purpose of Application Performance monitor is to quantify QoE (Quality of user Experience).Neither IXIA nor Sprint is suitable in such scenairios. TRex not either! Why?  TRex is DPDK based high performance traffic generator (reach 100Gbps), it rebuild TCP stack based on RPC standard (but maybe not latest, not mainstream), it can only represent one TCP model, may not full. If you are familer with operation system, you will know that TCP/IP stack is inside kernel,so we will not usually upgrade kernel, you can't say there is no update in OS release. Beside that, there are support system level  APIs to change TCP/IP stack parametersï¼Œsuch as retreansmit algorithom. Another tricky problem is that there are so many different types of end-point device, maybe it is a Windows PC, an Android Smartphone.... They may common TCP/IP stack with some mortal wisdom. So what I  believe is when you need measure network releated  parameters for Application, leverage system's TCP/IP stack. You can cover differenet endpoint device (both server and client)
